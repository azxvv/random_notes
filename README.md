Random Notes from Sickbed

Some summaries from the process of learning C++
Currently, the main focus is on updating
- Open source library
- C++ syntax

# Open source library
I will learn by adding comments to the open-source libraries I am currently studying, incorporating test programs, and using xmake for project management


# inih

inih is a simple .INI file parser written in C. It is designed to be small, compact, portable, and efficient. It is used in many applications, including some of the most popular Linux applications.

# cmockery

CMockery is a lightweight unit testing and mock framework designed specifically for the C language, developed and maintained by Google. Its design goal is to provide concise and easy-to-use testing tools, particularly suitable for C language projects.

# miniz 

Miniz is a lightweight, high-performance compression and decompression library that focuses on providing zlib compatible features while also being small in size and easy to integrate. It is widely used in scenarios that require efficient processing of DEFLATE compression algorithms (commonly used in formats such as ZIP, PNG, gzip, etc.), especially suitable for embedded systems, game development, or lightweight applications that have strict requirements for library size and memory usage.
